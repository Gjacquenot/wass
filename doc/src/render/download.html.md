# Download

Since WASS is actively developed on ***Linux*** and ***Mac OSX***, the
preferred way to obtain the latest version is by cloning the entire source
repository.

Open a terminal in a directory of your choice (we will later refer to that
directory as ```<WASS_ROOT>```) and enter the following commands:

```
$ git clone ####
$ git submodule update --init
```

Read the [Installation instructions](documentation/install.html) for a step-by-step tutorial
on how to build the source code depending on your system.


## Windows binaries

You can also download a windows binary distribution for Windows 7 (or higher) 64bit:

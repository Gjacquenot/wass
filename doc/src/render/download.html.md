The suggested way to obtain the latest version of WASS for ***Linux*** or
***Mac OSX*** is by cloning the project GitHub repository and compile it from
sources.

Open a terminal in a directory of your choice (we will later refer to that
directory as ```<WASS_ROOT>```) and enter the following commands:

```
$ git clone ####
$ cd wass
$ git submodule update --init
```

Read the [Installation instructions](documentation/install.html) for a step-by-step tutorial
on how to build the source code depending on your system.

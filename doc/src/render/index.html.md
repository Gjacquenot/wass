<p class="subtitle2">
WASS was developed by [Filippo Bergamasco](http://www.dsi.unive.it/~bergamasco/) as a joint-collaboration between [Universit√† Ca'Foscari di Venezia](http://www.unive.it) and [CNR ISMAR](http://www.ismar.cnr.it). It is a result of more than 3 years of active research with [Alvise Benetazzo](http://www.ismar.cnr.it/people/benetazzo-alvise) (CNR-ISMAR) in the field of accurate 3D surface reconstruction of sea waves.

# Features

- High-quality 3D point-cloud recovery from stereo frames
- Fully-automatic robust extrinsic calibration of the stereo rig (up to scale)
- Optimized C++ code for fast processing (~30sec per frame for 3 MPixel images on consumer i7 CPU)
- Advanced point-cloud filtering for outlier removal
- Easily controllable with your favourite browser
- Event-driven parallel task management via [node.js](http://www.nodejs.org)
- Open source code based on mature open-source components
- Multi-platform support (Linux, OSX, Windows)

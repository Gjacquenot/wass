# WASS

WASS (Waves Acquisition Stereo System) is an optimized stereo processing pipeline for sea waves 3D reconstruction.


It was developed by [Filippo Bergamasco](http://www.dsi.unive.it/~bergamasco/) as a joint-collaboration between [Universit√† Ca'Foscari di Venezia](http://www.unive.it) and [CNR ISMAR](http://www.ismar.cnr.it). It is a result of more than 3 years of active research with [Alvise Benetazzo](http://www.ismar.cnr.it/people/benetazzo-alvise) (CNR-ISMAR) in the field of accurate 3D surface reconstruction of sea waves.
